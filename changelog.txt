->The C# package is no longer required

14/03/2023:
This update addresses numerous issues that wouldn't allow the scan to finish properly with assistance from @Amorfirion on the tests and suggestions:

->Reverted textfile method as some users had issues with file permissions unable to scan
->The tool now scans blank files of hashnames rather than folders similar to before, this takes 10mins to extract, was 20mins+ on folders
->Addressed an issue on the main program that would take excessively long to finish a sound check
->All starting word checks are now declared at the top as simple strings to concatenate with others, this saves a lot of time of mass bruteforce checks too with regex FnR
->Removed a wpnsound list that was duped twice that wasn't supposed to be there
->Few more asset checks added
->Compile times are much faster, running a full scan on the main script only takes roughly 3mins

10/03/2023
->Read from text files instead of folders [xCortlandx]

07/03/2023:

With a lot going on, most changes listed are included with more in later updates:

->Specified path now scans all sub folders and prints results back from the containing folder to the root path (target ..\Path)
->Trimmed starting names on all hashes as they were already in a parent folder, writing assets for scanning is 50% faster (Reduced by 11MB)
->Trimmed the main program down (less wording before and after asset checks to help reduce the literal string cap for large scans)
->Removed fnv1a32 for it's high collision rate (false results)
->Redone the BO3 AssetLog and also include missing additional images, materials and effects
->Added all sounds from BO3/IW sabs/sabl
